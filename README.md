# Frontend Mentor - Browser Extensions Manager UI 🎯

This is my solution to the [Browser Extensions Manager UI challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/manage-browser-extensions-llPof5WUe) from Frontend Mentor. It replicates a responsive extensions dashboard with cards rendered dynamically from JSON data. The goal was to practice UI layout skills and deepen understanding of JavaScript-driven DOM manipulation.
